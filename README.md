## About

```Jot-a-lot is no longer maintained, but it was fun making this!```

Jotalot is a cross-platform mobile application that helps you focus on taking notes.

## What I've learned

- Everything is on the internet. Don't be afraid to Google things.
- Learn the basics, and start coding. You wouldn't just hear people speaking a language, you would write and talk to learn it.
- Nonstop learning. I have been working on this for about three weeks, and have always had something to learn.
- Do what's fun. I don't think you should start off with a timer app or something boring. I think a lot of people just watch videos passively on this and get bored. Code something that excites you.
- As long as you're learning, nothing is a waste of time. You'll keep making mistakes, but tackle them and don't put them aside.
- Articles online are life savers, and will learn a lot from them.
